This is my first repository.

--- Introduction --- 
First you install socket with the pip command pip install sockets.
If you haven't got pip download and install it by following this tutorial's : https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko9b_vC6XY0 

If you succesfully installed pip and socket you can jump to how to use the scripts.

--- How to use ---
First open the Server.py file to create a Server, then open the server_client.py file to connect with the Server.
Now you can type as a Client send the message with enter and you can respond with the server.

Notice : You can only send a message until the other one responds.
